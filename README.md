#BASIC APPLIANCE SHOP console app

This is a basic console app written in C++ to implement basic shop functionality.
Users can simulate purchases from a given list, the quantity and receive a bill.

A bill per purchase is generated in the text file (receipt.txt) and as output in the console each time it is run,
and a compilation of every purchase amount is recorded in an Excel file (purchases.xls) for administrative purposes.
